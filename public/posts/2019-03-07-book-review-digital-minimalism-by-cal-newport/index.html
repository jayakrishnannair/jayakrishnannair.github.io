When you are waiting for the train, there is a sight that will grab your attention every single day.

<p>As permanently connected devices have taken over our world., our attention span has shrunk. The endless bombardment of news, gossip, and fake news <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has<!-- raw HTML omitted --> made us information addicts. In this context, author, Cal Newport makes the case for choosing a focused life in a noisy world with the philosophy of Digital Minimalism. He argues that the current relationship with technology — where we are slaves to technology — is unsustainable and has to change.</p>
<p>“Your Time = Their Money.” This is the equation by which social media companies operate. Your attention is sold to advertisers. These companies have invested lots of energy in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->channelling<!-- raw HTML omitted --> human attention in a way that old media like newspapers and television could not do. They have invested a lot <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in figuring<!-- raw HTML omitted --> out how to exploit psychological <!-- raw HTML omitted -->vulnerabilities and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trick the user into spending more time with their app. It is no accident that you are addicted to your phone.</p>
<p>In fact, it is the new tobacco. Checking “likes” is the new smoking. The major issue is that it affects behavior. Within a few seconds of getting bored, people opt for their phones. Positive reinforcement coupled with the need for social approval is re-wiring our brains <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and this<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is due to the perfect execution of a massively profitable business plan.</p>
<p>Digital Minimalism is not about becoming a Luddite, but it is about you being in control of your life than technology wagging you. It goes beyond simple solutions like observing a digital sabbath and turning off notifications. It advocates being <!-- raw HTML omitted -->con<!-- raw HTML omitted -->cious of your media consumption. It is a philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else. Digital minimalists recognize that cluttering their time and attention with too many devices, apps, and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation.</p>
<p>The book also gives practical tips on how you can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->achive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this (eg, delete social media apps from the phone and use it on a computer). It also makes a call to have an enriching life by building things with your hand and having <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real life<!-- raw HTML omitted --> experience in the world instead of virtual ones. It also has tips <!-- raw HTML omitted -->from people<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who have adopted this ideology by reducing time spent online to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->focussing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on high-value activities. As argued, our current unease with new technologies is not really about whether or not they’re useful. It’s instead about autonomy. In this new state, digital technology is still <!-- raw HTML omitted -->present,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but now subordinated to a support role: helping you to set up or maintain your leisure activities, but not acting as the primary source of leisure itself.</p>
<p>While the initial part of the book is about the philosophy behind Digital Minimalism, the second part of the book is about actionable steps you can adopt. These steps are about making you from people analog than digital. It advocates getting out of passive consumption and instead <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spend<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that time doing a demanding activity which engages your brain. It calls to seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions. This is a timely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wake up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> call.</p>
