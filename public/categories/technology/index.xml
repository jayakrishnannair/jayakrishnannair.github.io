      <description>If you have installed Docker for the first time, it is better to verify the install with the command
docker run hello-world  When you ran that command and got the error “unauthorized: incorrect username or password”, read on. Most likely you would have entered your Docker hub e-mail and password. Big mistake.
The instruction says that you should loginwith your Docker ID. This Docker ID is not your e-mail. For thatyou need to login to Docker Hub with your e-mail and go to the Profile page.</description>

      <description>FROM node:alpine COPY ./ ./ RUN npm install CMD [&amp;quot;npm&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;start&amp;quot;]  If this is your Dockerfile and your node app starts at port 8080, then logically you would think that typing
http://localhost:8080  would give you access to the application. This works fine on OSX, but on a Windows 10 machine using Docker Toolkit, you will get an error message which says, that the browser can’t establish a connection to the server at localhost:8080.</description>
