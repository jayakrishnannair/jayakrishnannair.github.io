      <description>re:Invent was a huge conference with many venues and over 60,000 attendees. If you don’t plan properly, you will end up sitting in various shuttles, traveling up and down the strip. Here are some tips from my experience.
 Book your ticket early. The popular sessions fill up quickly and you will end up on the waiting list for most of them.    When the re:Invent planner says that the next venue is 30 minutes away, trust that.</description>

      <description>I attended the Velocity Conference in Santa Clara this year and these are few of the takeaways. If an image could summarize the conference, it would be this image from Scott Hanselman’s Keynote address, Virtual Machines, JavaScript and Assembler which was the most entertaining keynote I have ever heard.There were three main takeaways for me: APM is huge; everyone is into optimizing images and the CDNs are getting smarter.
APM is not American Public Media or Advanced Power Management or Actions Per Minute, but Application Performance Management.</description>
