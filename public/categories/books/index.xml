      <description>It would be an understatement to say obstacles are all around for people who got affected by COVID-19, for businesses that got impacted, and for people who got laid off in a 3 minute Zoom callor an e-mail in the morning.

      <description>Every day I have an hour commute by BART – San Francisco Bay Area’s delightful transit system. When you are waiting for the train, there is a sight that will grab your attention every single day. Everyone is on the phone, mindlessly swiping gems on a game, binge-watching Netflix, and catching up with the latest on their favorite social media outlet. Caught up in their screens, it is fun to see people miss their stations.</description>

He did 60 practice climbs on El Capitan. First, he rehearsed these climbs using rope. He memorized complex portions of the climb.</description>

      <description>In the book, High output management, Andy Grove, Intel co-founder, makes a significant observation regarding meetings. Let me frame it in the context of something that we encounter regularly in planning meetings. There are two projects, both of which can bring in revenue and a decision has to be made. To pick an example from the book, we could
 build a manufacturing plant next to an existing one build another larger one far away.</description>

Mohini had been confined to a 10-by-10-foot cage with a concrete floor for 5 or 10 years. They finally released her into this big pasture: With excitement and anticipation, they released Mohini into her new and expensive environment, but it was too late.</description>
