      <description>I attended the Velocity Conference in Santa Clara this year and these are few of the takeaways. If an image could summarize the conference, it would be this image from Scott Hanselmanâ€™s Keynote address, Virtual Machines, JavaScript and Assembler which was the most entertaining keynote I have ever heard.There were three main takeaways for me: APM is huge; everyone is into optimizing images and the CDNs are getting smarter.
APM is not American Public Media or Advanced Power Management or Actions Per Minute, but Application Performance Management.</description>
