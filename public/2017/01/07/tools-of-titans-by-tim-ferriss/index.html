<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our lives have been conditioned by our upbringing and past experience and as we age, it is hard to change. This can be illustrated by this story in the book<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is a story about a tiger named Mohini that was in captivity in a zoo, who was rescued from an animal sanctuary. Mohini had been confined to a 10-by-10-foot cage with a concrete floor for 5 or 10 years. They finally released her into this big pasture: With excitement and anticipation, they released Mohini into her new and expensive environment, but it was too late. The tiger immediately sought refuge in a corner of the compound, where she lived for the remainder of her life. She paced and paced in that corner until an area 10-by-10 feet was worn bare of grass<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Though, she had opportunities, the conditioned Mohini could not break free. This is also the reason why most of us lead an average, successful life because it doesn’t take much planning. Becoming extraordinary requires planning and routines that helps you distinguish from the other average people.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The new book by Tim Ferris is a compilation of the tools and techniques of extraordinary people whom he has interviewed in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim Ferris Show (Podcast)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It goes through the habits and routines of his guests and covers everything from diet, to exercise to career to bringing up kids and has actionable advice. There is one caveat though. What worked for Arnold Schwarzenegger might not work for you as very few people have his physique. What might work for you is that he practiced Transcendental Meditation for year and that altered his life.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One the tips which I liked is to create a list of things to do the next day before you go to sleep, because your subconscious will work on it. It comes from a quote by Edison — “Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are some of my favorite tips from the book.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diet<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ketogenic diet, often nicknamed “keto,” is a high-fat diet that mimics fasting physiology. Your brain and body begin to use ketones (derived from stored or ingested fat) for energy instead of blood sugar (glucose)—a state called ketosis. The diet was originally developed to treat epileptic children, but there are many variations, including the Atkins diet. You can achieve ketosis through fasting, diet, exogenous ketones, or a combination.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Exercise<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“There is value in exercise, though, and I think that the most important type of exercise, especially in terms of bang for your buck, is going to be really high-intensity, heavy strength training. Strength training aids everything from glucose disposal and metabolic health to mitochondrial density and orthopedic stability. That last one might not mean much when you’re a 30-something young buck, but when you’re in your 70s, that’s the difference between a broken hip and a walk in the park.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Throwing compression socks on [post-workout] is a game-changing experience<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Career<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Go to all the meetings you can, even if you’re not invited to them, and figure out how to be helpful. If people wonder why you’re there, just start taking notes. Read all the other notes you can find on the company, and gain a general knowledge that your very limited job function may not offer you. Just make yourself useful and helpful by doing so. That’s worked for me in a few different environments, and I encourage you to try it.” TF: Chris was well known at Google for showing up to meetings with anyone, including the co-founders. Even if attendees looked at each other puzzled, Chris would sit down and let them know he’d be taking notes for them. It worked. He got a front-row seat to the highest levels of Google and soon became a fixture in those meetings.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When you can write well, you can think well.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Investing in yourself is the most important investment you’ll ever make in your life. . . . There’s no financial investment that’ll ever match it, because if you develop more skill, more ability, more insight, more capacity, that’s what’s going to really provide economic freedom. . . . It’s those skill sets that really make that happen.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“I think up through probably 35, I was very much a control freak, because the size of the organizations I commanded, and I was part of, were small enough where I could micromanage them. I had a fairly forceful personality, and if you worked hard and studied hard, you could just about move all the chess pieces, no problem. Around age 35 to 40, as you get up to battalion level, which is about 600 people, suddenly, you’re going to have to lead it a different way, and what you’re really going to have to do is develop people. The advice I’d give to anyone young is it’s really about developing people who are going to do the work. Unless you are going to go do the task yourself, then the development time you spend on the people who are going to do that task, whether they are going to lead people doing it or whether they are actually going to do it, every minute you spend on that is leveraged, is exponential return.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“What could possibly be more important than your kid? Please don’t play the busy card. If you spend 2 hours a day without an electronic device, looking your kid in the eye, talking to them and solving interesting problems, you will raise a different kid than someone who doesn’t do that. That’s one of the reasons why I cook dinner every night. Because what a wonderful, semi-distracted environment in which the kid can tell you the truth. For you to have low-stakes but superimportant conversations with someone who’s important to you.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“I think we need to teach kids two things: 1) how to lead, and 2) how to solve interesting problems. Because the fact is, there are plenty of countries on Earth where there are people who are willing to be obedient and work harder for less money than us. So we cannot out-obedience the competition. Therefore, we have to out-lead or out-solve the other people.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“The way you teach your kids to solve interesting problems is to give them interesting problems to solve. And then, don’t criticize them when they fail. Because kids aren’t stupid. If they get in trouble every time they try to solve an interesting problem, they’ll just go back to getting an A by memorizing what’s in the textbook. I spend an enormous amount of time with kids . . . I think that it’s a privilege to be able to look a trusting, energetic, smart 11-year-old in the eye and tell him the truth. And what we can say to that 11-year-old is: ‘I really don’t care how you did on your vocabulary test. I care about whether you have something to say.’”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“When you raise your kids, you’re the bow, they’re the arrow, and you just try to aim them in the best direction that you can, and hopefully your aim isn’t too off. That’s what [my grandmother] did for me.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Translated to writing, I was told my goal should be “two crappy pages a day.” That’s it. If you hit two crappy pages, even if you never use them, you can feel “successful” for the day. Sometimes you barely eke out two pages, and they are truly terrible. But at least 50% of the time, you’ll produce perhaps 5, 10, or even—on the rare miracle day—20 pages. Draft ugly and edit pretty.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of the book, if you ask, if there is one habit that 80% of the people have, that is meditation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->More than 80% of the world-class performers I’ve interviewed have some form of daily meditation or mindfulness practice. Both can be thought of as “cultivating a present-state awareness that helps you to be nonreactive.” This applies to everyone from Arnold Schwarzenegger to Justin Boreta of The Glitch Mob , and from elite athletes like Amelia Boone to writers like Maria Popova . It’s the most consistent pattern of them all.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One question which Tim asked every person is the book they have gifted the most and hence you get an extraordinary list of books for your reading list. These range from  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Journey Home: Autobiography of an American Swami<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Radhanath Swami to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Steve Martin. Thus the learning does not have to end with this book.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two of my favorite quotes are in career section. The first one is from Stanley McChrystal and Chris Fussell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You should have a running list of three people that you’re always watching: someone senior to you that you want to emulate, a peer who you think is better at the job than you are and who you respect, and someone subordinate who’s doing the job you did—one, two, or three years ago—better than you did it. If you just have those three individuals that you’re constantly measuring yourself off of, and you’re constantly learning from them, you’re going to be exponentially better than you are.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second is from Scott Adams. This is a bit long, but worth reading fully<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you want an average, successful life, it doesn’t take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths: 1) Become the best at one specific thing. 2) Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things. The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don’t recommend anyone even try. The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare.And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it. I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only one skill. Or get a degree in business on top of your engineering degree, law degree, medical degree, science degree, or whatever. Suddenly you’re in charge, or maybe you’re starting your own company using your combined knowledge. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You make yourself rare by combining two or more “pretty goods” until no one else has your mix. . . . At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal. And it could be as simple as learning how to sell more effectively than 75% of the world. That’s one. Now add to that whatever your passion is, and you have two, because that’s the thing you’ll easily put enough energy into to reach the top 25%. If you have an aptitude for a third skill, perhaps business or public speaking, develop that too. It sounds like generic advice, but you’d be hard-pressed to find any successful person who didn’t have about three skills in the top 25%.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
