<blockquote>
<p>I try to set my own agenda and not to allow technology to set the agenda for me. I tend to read books, long books, rather than short passages or tweets. I think another thing that has happened over the last century is that we have moved from an information scarcity to a deluge of information. Previously the main problem with information for people was that they didn’t have enough of it, and there was censorship, and information was very rare and hard to obtain. Now it’s just the opposite. We are inundated by immense amounts of information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We really lose control of our attention. Our attention is hijacked by all kinds of external forces. For me, not just in meditation, but when I work, I try to be very, very disciplined with my attention not to allow external forces to take control of my attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth listening to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->entire podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as he also talks about how <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vipassana<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> changed his life.
