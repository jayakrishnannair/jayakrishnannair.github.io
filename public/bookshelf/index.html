<p><a href="https://www.shooonya.org/2020/07/cracking-the-coding-interview-with-deliberate-practice/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/shooonya-photos-1.s3.amazonaws.com/peak.png?ssl=1#float" alt="Peak"></a> Forget Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s 10,000 hour rule. This book corrects Gladwell and introduces the concept of deliberate practice. Deliberate practice has several characteristics that set it apart from “naive practice,” which is just doing something repeatedly, expecting that the repetition alone will improve one’s performance. Deliberate practice pushes you out of your comfort zone. It also involves feedback. This could come from a teacher or coach or it could come from your experience to monitor and improve. For example, in the trapping the rainwater, if you did not use a two-pointer solution, but a Priority Queue, then you would use that observation as feedback to analyze and improve.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.shooonya.org/2017/01/07/tools-of-titans-by-tim-ferriss/"><img src="https://d2sa5t9ngheghz.cloudfront.net/tools-titans.png#float" alt="Tools of Titans"></a> This book by Tim Ferris is a compilation of the tools and techniques of extraordinary people whom he has interviewed in the Tim Ferris Show (Podcast). It goes through the habits and routines of his guests and covers everything from diet, to exercise to career to bringing up kids and has actionable advice. There is one caveat though. What worked for Arnold Schwarzenegger might not work for you as very few people have his physique. What might work for you is that he practiced Transcendental Meditation for year and that altered his life.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.shooonya.org/2019/03/book-review-digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport/"><img src="https://d2sa5t9ngheghz.cloudfront.net/digital-minimalism.png#float" alt="Digital Minimalism"></a> As permanently connected devices have taken over our world., our attention span has shrunk. The endless bombardment of news, gossip, and fake news has made us information addicts. In this context, author, Cal Newport makes the case for choosing a focused life in a noisy world with the philosophy of Digital Minimalism. He argues that the current relationship with technology — where we are slaves to technology — is unsustainable and has to change.</p>

Articulated by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in the second century, Stoicism has become popular in the past decade. The basic idea is simple —that the control of consciousness determines the quality of life.</p>
