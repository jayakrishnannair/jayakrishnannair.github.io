If you follow the [Galloway Run/Walk technique][1] for running, then you need an interval timer. Previously, I used to run a timer on my phone, but with the purchase of the **Garmin Vivosmart HR+**, this has become simple. You can set the walk-run intervals on the band, and it will remind you.

These steps have to be performed on the Garmin Connect app on your phone. The screen shots are from Android.

Open the side menu on the app and click on the image of Vivosmart HR+ at the top right (the one next to the green dot)
