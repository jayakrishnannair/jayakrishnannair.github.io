If you highlight the books you read on a Kindle Paperwhite and would like to extract them as text into your word processor or OneNote, then there is a simple way. Use [clippings.io][2]. This simple web application reads the clippings text file on the Paperwhite and neatly organizes the notes.

But if you are making your highlights on a Kindle Fire, then [there is no text file to import][3]. The highlights are stored inside the [mbp file][4] and it is not easy to extract the highlights. [Amazon has a page][5] which shows your highlights, but it is not user-friendly, especially if  if you are a book reviewer, who has hundreds of highlights.

Looking for a solution, I stumbled on [bookcision][6].  The steps are simple; there is no software to install and just using your browser, you can get all your highlights as a text file.
