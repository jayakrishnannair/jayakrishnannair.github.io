One of the common solutions on the web to detect if you are a bot or not is captcha. This is that familiar form where some ugly looking text is presented as an image and you are challenged to type it. This may have deterred bots for a period of time, but it frustrated real users. Eventually the bots got smarter. [Mori and Malik write][1] that they were able to achieve a success rate of 92%.

Now there is a new version of captcha called reCAPTCHA from Google. [According to the documentation][2], this version will allow a significant amount of users to verify they are not a bot and the captcha puzzle will be triggered only for a few users.

In this example we will look at an implementation of reCAPTCHA using node.js and angular.js. We will enhance an existing form with reCAPTCHA and add the backend code to verify the reCAPTCHA response. This article will show step by step instructions on introducing the changes in your code. It assumes that you have good working knowledge of Angular and Node. You can always get the final working version from GitHub.

#### Frontend Changes

In this section, we will add the reCAPTCHA widget to a form like this

[<img loading="lazy" class=" size-medium wp-image-16 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.shooonya.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/form-300x297.png?resize=300%2C297" alt="form" width="300" height="297" data-recalc-dims="1" />][3]

<h4 style="text-align: left;">
  Step 1: Get site key and secret
</h4>

On the [admin page][4], register a new site to get the site key and secret. Of these, the site key is used on the frontend code and the secret in the backend.

#### Step 2: Display reCAPTCHA widget on the form

In the <head> of the html page, add the following

<pre class="prettyprint"><span class="pln">Â </span><b><span class="tag">&lt;script</span> <span class="atn">src</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js"</span> <span class="atn">async</span> <span class="atn">defer</span><span class="tag">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></b></pre>

Then in the form, add the following div

<pre class="prettyprint"><b><span class="tag">&lt;div</span> <span class="atn">class</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"g-recaptcha"</span> <span class="atn">data-sitekey</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"your_site_key"</span><span class="tag">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span></b></pre>

Once you replace the data-sitekey with your key from Step 1, your form will look like this

[<img loading="lazy" class="  wp-image-14 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.shooonya.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-10.36.32-PM-251x300.png?resize=324%2C387" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-27 at 10.36.32 PM" width="324" height="387" data-recalc-dims="1" />][5]

This is the simplest way of getting the the widget on you page.
